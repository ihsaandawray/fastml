# fastml - learning about machine learning

A collection of notebooks where I implement machine learning concepts and techniques through small projects.

## projects

Each project in this repository is supposed to cover a specific area of machine learning:

1. **MNIST in Numpy** - for understanding backprop, based on Karpathy's [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd/tree/master) 
2. **Text Generation with RNNs**  
3. **Random Forests for Classification** 
4. **...** 

## contribution

Feel free to offer any suggestions, advice, and discussions on the topics covered.
